# Python
This repository contains basic Python programs that I have designed to teach fellow students the fundamentals of Python.

# Overview
In this repository, the primary focus is on Python syntax and semantics. I have illustrated the use of various built-in libraries through other platforms. This initiative was part of an effort to teach fellow students through hands-on online sessions.
